# SIMPLE WEB APP BUILT AT TOP OF DJANGO WITH ADD TO CART FUNCTIONALITY

I tried to make it simple with AJAX call to avoid page reload at each and every time user clicks on add to cart buttona on frontend.
Another thing to keep in mind is that even unauthenticated users can be able to add product in cart and when they sign in, they can get their cart back with added product.

#### All above stuffs are yet to be completed. However, Add to cart and session are working so fine, user can leave browser and comeback at a certain time and find his/her cart alive in session.

# OAUTH ATHENTICATION COMING SOON...
